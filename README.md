# HuskyLens
This repository includes implementing the seven functions in the HuskyLens, also when a face is detected by the HuskyLens the Led will turn on.


Step 1:
Connect the HuskyLens with the USB.


Step 2:
Install the HUSKYLENS Library to the Arduino IDE folder. 



Step 3:
Used the function button to switch between different functions and press the Learning button to start the learning process. 


Step 4:
Repeat the process of training and testing the 7 functions.

Step 5:

HuskyLens connections:

1-The T to the SDA in the Arduino board. 

2-The R to the SCL in the Arduino board. 

3-The - to the GND pin in the Arduino board.

3-The + to the 5V pin in the Arduino board.

LED connections:

1-The shorter leg of the LED is connected to the resistor and it is connected to the GND on the Arduino board.

2-The other side of the resistor is connected to the GND on the Arduino board.

3-The longer leg of the LED is connected to pin 7 on the Arduino board.



Step 6:

write the code.

Output:

when the face the LED will turn on.
